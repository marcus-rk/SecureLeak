uhhhh, that looks like a silly bug
wonder why no one popped this yet xdd
yeah this one feels spicy
I love when prod says "it works on my machine"
tiny payload, big oof
this UI gaslit me for 10 minutes
chef’s kiss repro
spicy screenshot pls
my toaster could exploit this
feels like a day-one patch moment
not me triggering this on the homepage
vibes are immaculate and insecure
speedrun any% account takeover
oops, all user data
classic footgun unlocked
the 90s called, they want their CSP
who needs auth anyway
+1, cannot unsee this now
bookmarking for later shenanigans
devs when they see this: 😅
sending thoughts and rate limits
the logs are screaming
press F to pay respects
someone ship a hotfix burrito
this belongs on r/ProgrammerHumor
works in Firefox, breaks in Chrome
saw this on v1.2.3 too
looks like input not sanitized
DM me if you need details
smells like an S3 policy issue
please add rate limiting to login
referer check might help
CSP report-only won’t cut it
route needs owner check
smallest payload that triggers?
keep this private until fixed
anyone got a screenshot?
sanitize user input server-side
parameterize queries, never concat
use helmet + strict CSP in Node
rotate tokens after password reset
reproduce with: curl -X POST -d ...
repros with default settings
likely a header parsing bug
only fails when logged out
blur/redact screenshots before posting
impact looks high, confirm scope
threat model: logged-out attacker
CWE-79 likely (XSS)
CWE-352 fits (CSRF)
