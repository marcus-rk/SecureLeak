repro:
1) GET /search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>
payload reflected in response
impact: cookie theft / phishing
observed on staging and prod-like
root cause: unescaped user input in template
fix: escape output and add CSP
temporary: filter <script> tags on input
steps:
create a new comment with payload
visit profile page to trigger
note: reproduces with authenticated users too
affected versions: 1.2.0 - 1.2.4
mitigation: update template rendering
impact: remote code execution risk (if chained)
example header: Referer: http://evil/
server shows stack trace with query
payload example: ' OR 1=1 --
observed slow response under load
suggested patch: parameterized queries only
severity: high / medium / low
reproduce with curl -v
screenshot attached (see uploads)
console shows error and trace
do not disclose publicly until fixed
reported by: community member
note: attacker can view other users' items
PoC: curl -H 'X-Forwarded-Host: evil.tld'
bypass: add ?_method=DELETE
CSRF token missing on POST
SameSite cookie not set
session persists after password change
jwt secret is short (8 chars)
accepts alg=none token
file upload accepts .php disguised as .png
content-type not validated server-side
CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
preflight allows Authorization header
open redirect via return_url
IDOR: change id=123 to id=124
rate limit: none on /login
brute force feasible (~1k/min)
cache: Vary header missing
host header used in cache key
leak: verbose 500 page dumps env
headers: X-Frame-Options missing
add frame-ancestors 'none'
CSP report-only only, not enforced
log includes email + IP + session id
sanitize stack traces in prod
disable debug endpoints in prod
set HSTS for apex + subdomains
samesite=lax recommended
require re-auth for sensitive changes
tokens not invalidated after use
webhook signature not verified
GraphQL introspection enabled
pagination missing, loads entire list
memory spike under load test
time-based user enumeration on login
password reset link valid after use
2FA backup codes reusable
upgrade dependency X to >= y.z
rollback if patch breaks compat

uhhhh, that’s a spicy bug
tiny payload, big oof
who needs auth anyway
speedrun any% account takeover
classic footgun unlocked
oops, all admin
devs when they see this: 😅
chef’s kiss PoC
please don’t try this in prod (lol)
this belongs on r/netsec
can confirm on mobile too
“works on my machine” energy
logs are yelling at me
bookmarking for later shenanigans
someone ship a hotfix burrito
vibes: very exploitable
impact: yikes
threat model: logged-out attacker
CWE-79 fits (XSS)
CWE-352 likely (CSRF)
references: OWASP cheat sheets
cvss rough: 7.5 (est.)
node tip: helmet + strict CSP
sanitize inputs server-side
parameterize queries, never concat
rotate tokens after password reset
repro stable on slow network
minimal PoC posted above
