Add 5–8 small PNGs here to attach to seeded reports.

Naming tips:
- Prefer descriptive names like bug_01.png, poc_auth_bypass.png, sqli_console.png
- Avoid the prefix "placeholder_" — the seeder ignores files named placeholder_*.png
- Keep each file small (<100 KB) so the repo stays light
- PNG format only (the seeder sets mimetype to image/png)

If this folder is empty, seeding still works — reports will just be created without images.
